# Bayesian_Spatio_temporal_analysis_of_dengue
 In this repo I use bayesian method and the R-ilna package to analyse the underlying spatio temporal patterns of dengue fever in brazil. The pdf is the easiest way to
 to view the results and the code can be viewed in the supplementary material. Please refer to the pdf that has my full report to better understand the code and what is going on here. Thanks
